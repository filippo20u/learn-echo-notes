16:25:26	 From Ara Jo : ^^ thanks
16:26:41	 From Ara Jo : TechHire San Diego: https://workforce.org/techhire/
16:27:18	 From LEARN Classroom Turing : TechHire might not be working in most places in San Diego anymore, due to funding shortage as of recent. Definitely take a look to see if they are in your area.
16:28:42	 From Ara Jo : ^^True. However, they also have their own job portal so you could get exclusive access. Also many workshops are provided like interview skills and resumes
16:30:16	 From LEARN Classroom Turing : Aye, right now they are only accepting applicants from Chula Vista residents :)
16:36:14	 From Alan : no pain no gain 
16:36:31	 From Mina Chuong (she/her) : burn out prevention!
16:37:27	 From Alan : programming memes gets you jobs
16:49:29	 From Brian Harrington : Agree, no job is alike
16:50:16	 From Alan : question-when does the pain stop
16:50:24	 From Ara Jo : NEVER
16:50:40	 From Alan : :'(
16:51:02	 From Ara Jo : I guess if you decide it to be pain, it will be pain
16:51:11	 From Ryan S : YES
16:51:14	 From Ara Jo : but if you decide it to be learning struggling then it is :)
16:51:16	 From Rachael : Dang ara so negative!
16:51:22	 From Ryan S : lol
16:51:25	 From Ara Jo : lol
16:51:26	 From LEARN Classroom Turing : Fr! lol
16:51:29	 From Alan : lmao its just fax
16:51:35	 From Ara Jo : ^^
16:51:48	 From Rachael : It doesn‚Äôt get easier necessarily but if you like it and enjoy your work, you‚Äôll feel fulfilled.
16:51:54	 From Mina Chuong (she/her) : Brian, I love that metaphor
16:51:54	 From Alan : so the pain never stops good to know 
16:51:58	 From Alan : jk lol
16:53:14	 From Ara Jo : I personally think it gets easier when you know what question to ask in google...
16:53:30	 From Ara Jo : in the beginning you don‚Äôt even know what to ask or how to form the question
16:53:47	 From Alan : i just be asking like how do i do this lol
16:53:47	 From Ara Jo : But once you know what you don‚Äôt know it gets easier
16:53:52	 From LEARN Classroom Turing : First month google questions: ‚ÄúHOW MAKE CODE DO THING‚Äù
16:53:55	 From Ara Jo : lol
16:54:02	 From LEARN Classroom Turing : 4th mon google question: ‚ÄúHow to define datatype in Javascript"
16:54:08	 From Ara Jo : ^^^^^
16:54:09	 From Alan : how to code for dummies
16:54:52	 From Ara Jo : Yes, you will learn more terms and concepts as you go, so you will now what you don‚Äôt know and know what the term is for
16:54:52	 From LEARN Classroom Turing : It definitely gets easier, because you learn how to utilize your tools of your trade properly to find the answers.
16:55:59	 From LEARN Classroom Turing : First two weeks of wood working, a huge pain in the booty, no idea what tool to use to make the wood to the thing you want to. It the same concept in coding. You may have a garage full of tools, that can do a ton of cool things, but you need to take time to learn them. After awhile, you start realizing you can use the table saw to quickly cut wood, instead of a kitchen knife.
16:56:56	 From Mina Chuong (she/her) : self-preservation is so important haha
