tables (city country, country laanguage)  country +> columns

syntax
capitalize all the POS

SELECT represents all the columns * (all)
FROM   which table you want to select from  country 

SELECT name, population, lifeexpectancy, gnp
FROM country 
"hit play"

WHERE  (uses comparison operator)
WHERE gnp > 1e+6
WHERE surfacearea > 100000

WHERE governmentform
IN ('Republic', 'Monarchy')   allows to group options

WHERE governmentform
LIKE '%onarchy'

WHERE 
NOT continent = 'North America'

WHERE governmentform
LIKE '%@%.com%'


and and or &&  ||

SELECT name, continent, population  (THESE INQUIRY THE OUTPUT!!!!!!)
FROM country
WHERE population >1e+8
OR gnp > 1e+6

there's no gnp at the top, so I don't have gnp in the output,


SELECT name, continent, population  (THESE INQUIRY THE OUTPUT!!!!!!)
FROM country
WHERE population >1e+8
AND gnp > 1e+6

SELECT name, population, governmentform
FROM country
WHERE pgovernmentform IN ('Republic', 'Monarchy")
ORDER BY     population (ascending)

SELECT name, population, governmentform
FROM country
WHERE pgovernmentform IN ('Republic', 'Monarchy")
ORDER BY population DESC

SELECT name, population, governmentform
FROM country
WHERE pgovernmentform IN ('Republic', 'Monarchy")
ORDER BY population DESC (descending optional obv!)
LIMIT 5         how many rows

SELECT name, gnp/population AS gnp_per_capita  ( create a piece of output, a column that will represent the value, it needs snake case )
FROM country
LIMIT 20



SELECT name, gnp/population AS gnp_per_capita  ( create a piece of output, a column that will represent the value, it needs snake case )

WITH (sub query of my output)

WITH populated_cuntries AS (
    SELECT name, population
    FROM country 
    WHERE population > 0
    )
SELECT name
FROM populated_countries
ORDER BY  population
LIMIT 10

WITH populated_cuntries AS (
    SELECT name, population
    FROM country 
    WHERE population > 0
    )
SELECT name
FROM populated_countries
ORDER BY  population
LIMIT 10 DESC


---------- AGGREGATED FUNCTIONS -----------
SELECT SUM(population)
FROM country

SELECT governmentform, COUNT(*)
FROM country
GROUP BY governmentform
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 1

GROUP BY  use with select 

SELECT region, AVG(lifeexpectancy)
FROM country
GROUP BY region


how many countries are in eastern africa
SELECT region, COUNT(name)
FROM country
WHERE region = 'Eastern Africa"
